# Speed Typing App

Speed Typing App is written in React and it allows users to test their blind typing skills.

The user can choose the number of words and the app will fetch random words from random-word-api.herokuapp.com . The timer starts running when the users starts typing. The user's input is constantly being checked and the game stops when every input letter is correct or the user makes a mistake. If the users succeeds, the timer stops and the average speed is calculated.

Building this app helped me solidify my React knowledge I already had, and I also learned about new hooks, conditional rendering based on state, using loading animations and React Portals.
